and never a soul in the world would know of this our pilgrimage to no country and to no end.

If I could save time in a bottle
the first thing that I'd like to do
is to save every day until eternity passes away
just to spend them with you
If I could save time in a bottle
the first thing that I'd like to do
is to save every day until eternity passes away
just to spend them with you
If I could make days last forever
if words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then
again I would spend them with you.

Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
